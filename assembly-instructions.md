Conveyor Assembly Instructions


Assembly Tips:

Nuts go into the clean (non-charred) side better. 
If a nut gets stuck squeezing between 2 coins helps. 
370 Motors & solenoid have M3 8mm Long screws
385 Motors have an hard to find M2.6 x .45 size. 

All screws are 3/8” 4-40 unless you use guides. Use 1/2" Long screws with the guides. 

Only snug screws until everything it together, then finish tightening. 

Make a Belt:
The belts should be 95% the length of the distance between the motor shafts.
The glossy side should be the inside on the belt. The mat side is stickier. 
Cut 30mm wide belt:
	20cm Feeder/scanner Conveyor
	22cm short conveyor
	44.5cm hopper & accumulator conveyors
	104cm scanning conveyor

Heat seal (bond) smooth side in (Bright lighting helps)
I use an 8" $25 heat sealer for poly bags with a 2mm element.(3mm would be better)(A custom bonding rig would be nicer).
Scotch tape a 1mm overlap. 
Turn it inside out so the tape side is opposite the heating element before heat sealing. 
Heat seal 2 times to get the both side of the 1mm whole seam for .3mm thick
Heat seal 1 time for .15mm thick 
	On the dial I use a 2 setting for 0.15mm and 4.5 setting for 0.3mm
Remove Tape
Try not to heat seal a single layer area as this will thin it out. 
The clear belting is sticky. I sand all top plates with 220 sand paper. I wonder what grit is the best. 

Assembly Instructions:
	Add the 17mm coupling(tubing) to the motor
	Put the 60mm shaft on the other side of the couple
	There should be about a 1mm of tubing in the middle. 

Mount the motor	to the motor rail with:
	385 motor: M3x.5 x 8mm long screws.
	270? or 25mm gearmotors: M2.6 x 8mm long cap screws

Screw on top plate to motor rail
Add a bearing to the motor shaft
Add Middle Rail to top plate with 2 screws

Change this: it’s easier to then put on shafts, then belt, then side rail. 

If using guides:	
Add them with three 5/8” screws instead of two ½” screws
Guides need shim washers between the top plate and the guide


Add the second side rail to top plate with 2 screws, adding the second bearing in the process

If using guides:	
Add them with three 5/8” screws instead of two ½” screws
Guides need shim washers between the top plate and the guide
Tighten guides with guide spacer in-between. 

Add shorter 42mm long 2mm shaft with 3/16 spacer pulleys:
	2 longer spacers on the end, and one shorter spacer in the middle. 
Put the belt on.

Add motor end plate
Add end plate

Final screw tightening:
Squeeze the side rails together when tightening the end plates. 
Don’t tighten top plate super tight as it will crown. 

Belt change:
Take off the end plates. 
Find a way to make it so you don’t have to take off the end plates? 
3 ½ minutes to change the belt with taking the end plates off. 
Squeeze the side rails together when tightening the end plates.
